    "# WISPcloud API tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "For accessing data collected by WISPstation instruments, [Water Insight](http://www.waterinsight.nl/ \"WI's Homepage\") offers an application programming interface (API). This API allows users to dynamically retrieve data from the WISPcloud database using a URL. This document is a short introduction to the WISPcloud API. Please note that this is still very much work in progress. Any feedback is appreciated!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing the API\n",
    "There are several ways to access the API:\n",
    "* Using a web browser. Simply type or copy the request into the address bar and the browser will display the text file.\n",
    "* Using a command-line tool such as [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se// \"cURL Homepage\") \n",
    "* Directly in a script \n",
    "\n",
    "We will show examples for these options below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API is password protected. As a user of a WISPstation, you should have received login credentials. There is also an open demo account:\n",
    "> username: demo\n",
    "\n",
    "> password: demo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access via a web browser\n",
    "Simply paste the url in your browser's address bar. For a quick view, such as the ShowRecent request, using your browser is an easy and convenient way to access the API. Please note that this is not advised when retrieving larger amounts of data as browsers may at a given point stop downloading additional data without producing an error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing via a command-line tool\n",
    "For larger amounts of data or as part of a recurrent processing, it can be useful to download data from the API to file. This can be done using the [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se// \"cURL Homepage\")  tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "curl -u username:password -o filename.tsv \"https://wispcloud.waterinsight.nl/api/query?SERVICE=Data&VERSION=1.0&REQUEST=GetData&TIME=2018-05-11T09:00,2018-05-11T19:00&INSTRUMENT=WISPstation001\"\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing the API directly in python\n",
    "If working with the data in a script/program, the easiest way is to directly access the API from your script and read the returned data. For example, in python you could \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "import io\n",
    "\n",
    "username = 'demo'\n",
    "password = 'demo'\n",
    "url = 'https://wispcloud.waterinsight.nl/api/query?SERVICE=Data&VERSION=1.0&REQUEST=GetData&TIME=2018-05-11T09:00,2018-05-11T19:00&INSTRUMENT=WISPstation001'\n",
    "datastring = io.StringIO(requests.get(url, auth=(username, password)).content.decode('utf-8')).read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the request URL\n",
    "The request URL is built on a base URL: \n",
    "> https:wispcloud.waterinsight.nl/api/query?\n",
    "\n",
    "followed by several key-value pairs which are built up as follows:\n",
    "* values are assigned to keys by a \"=\"\n",
    "* several values for the same key are separated by \",\"\n",
    "* key-value pairs are separated by \"&\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All our requests use the service \"Data\". The current version is 1.0. Therefore, all request URLs will start with \n",
    "> https:wispcloud.waterinsight.nl/api/query?SERVICE=Data&VERSION=1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "followed by the specific request (see below). The keys are case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### GetDocumentation\n",

    "\n",
    "### ShowRecent\n",
    "The ShowRecent request returns a fixed-format file of the most recent WISPstation measurements in WISPcloud that the user has access to. \n",

    "\n",
    "The reply is a comma-separated file giving the measurement id, device name and timestamp of the 30 most recent measurements that the user has access to:\n",

    ">Please note that queries that return raw spectral data will return a substantial volume of data on every row, and as there are typically sixty level 1b spectra on just the measurement channels (10 repeats on six channels), it also returns a lot of rows per measurement. The service is written to happily keep sending results to the requesting client until done, but for most practical purposes we strongly recommend limiting the scope of your request to a narrow window of time and location to keep down the size of the results! This is critically important when you view the results in a web browser rather than saving them directly to file, because it is very easy to make a web browser (which wants to cache the file it is displaying) run completely out of memory! Using a tool like curl to pull something from the api straight into a file on disk should be safe.\n",

    "The request l1b is for advanced users only. Whereas the spectral data that are returned by the GetData request are averaged over 10 spectra and quality screened, the l1b request returns the raw calibrated radiance and irradiance spectra as recorded by the instrument. The return format is fixed, it is not possible to change the columns in the output. However, selecting by date, location and instrument works the same as for the GetData request.\n",

    "The response of the l1b request is different from the GetData request as each row in the GetData response is one measurement, whereas in the l1b response each row is one separate spectrum. This means we have 60 rows for one single measurement (6 channels: 2 each for Ed, Ld and Lu) with 10 repeat measurements each. In practice, there might even be 70 spectra as there is a reference channel. All the rows of each measurement have the same measurement id, they also include a reference to the channel type (channel.type) and channel postition (channel.position). The combination of channel type and channel position uniquely identifies a channel on the instrument in the following way:\n",
    "- Ed A: Ed at the back 'aft' top of the instrument\n",
    "- Ed F: Ed at the front 'fore' top of the instrument\n",
    "- Ld P: Ld channel at the left 'port' front of the instrument\n",
    "- Ld S: Ld channel at the right 'starboard' front of the instrument\n",
    "- Lu P: Lu channel at the left 'port' front of the instrument\n",
    "- Lu S: Lu channel at the right 'starboard' front of the instrument\n",
    "- (EQC): Reference channel that is not exposed to light, should be ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the radiance channels are \"cross-eyed\", i.e. they look across the center line of the instrument. So the right \"starboar\" Lu and Ld channels look at 337.5 degree and the left \"port\" channels at 22.5 from the instrument orientation, usually north. This information is also provided by the site.azimuth and channel.orientation columns. So if the site.azimuth is 180 (facing south) the Lu P channel (channel.orientation 22.5) will be looking at 202.5 degree from north. It is up to the user to construct a dataset from these individual spectra."
